# Geolocation Data for Network Management

This repository hosts a geofeed CSV file providing accurate geolocation information for specific IP addresses, in accordance with RFC 8805 guidelines. The geofeed format offers a standardized way to share geolocation data, enhancing the accuracy of IP-based geolocation services.

## About Geofeeds

A geofeed is a CSV file that maps IP addresses or networks to geographical locations, including country, region, city, and postal code. This standard, detailed in RFC 8805, allows network administrators and owners to correct and distribute geolocation information for their IP ranges efficiently.

## Geofeed Format

The geofeed file in this repository follows the specified CSV format:

- `network`: A valid IP address or network range, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.
- `iso_country_code`: A valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
- `iso_region_code`: A valid ISO 3166-2 region code for the specified country.
- `city_name`: The name of the city associated with the IP address or network.
- `postal_code`: (Optional) The postal code for the location.

Example entry:
network,iso_country_code,iso_region_code,city_name,postal_code
164.68.126.229,DE,BY,Nuremberg,90455


## Purpose

The primary aim of this repository is to ensure that the geolocation information associated with our networks is as accurate as possible. By publicly sharing this data, we can assist IP-based geolocation services in correctly identifying the geographical location of our IP addresses, improving the overall user experience for services that rely on this information.

## How to Use

The geofeed file can be directly accessed and downloaded by geolocation service providers and network administrators. Updates to the geolocation data will be periodically made to reflect any changes in network configurations or corrections to existing entries.
